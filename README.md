# KNN analysis & implementation on MNIST dataset

Project for Statistical Learning Theory @TU Eindhoven.
Implementation of KNN algorithm on MNIST dataset (handwritted digits classification). 
The report present some evaluation & consideration about this algorithm and problem such as its performance, the suitable number of neighbors, the best distance_metric. 
At the same time, we consider the high-dimension of the images and apply Principal Components analysis and some image-blurring techniques on the image to improve classification accuracy.
